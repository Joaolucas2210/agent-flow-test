# Eval diagnose — the macro step of the improvement loop (Fase 4).
# Reads docs/evals/results.csv (the outcomes) + runs/*.trajectory.md (the evidence)
# and asks the only question that matters across many runs: which cases fail, and
# do they REPEAT? Each failing case gets an improvement-proposal stub pointing at
# its evidence. It proposes; a human decides the fix (CLAUDE.md principle 5).
#
#   Nothing is auto-fixed. No LLM in the loop. The CSV is the truth.
#   A case failing in >=2 distinct commits is flagged "recurring".
#   gate=skipped-* is "no signal", NOT a failure (honest, same policy as the gate).
#
# Usage: eval-diagnose.sh          (exit 0 always — it's a report, not a gate)
